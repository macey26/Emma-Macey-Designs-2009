      <p class="style4 style6 style7">      Hi, my name is Emma Macey and  welcome to my <a href="Portfolio.html" class="style8">portfolio</a> site. On this website you can see my design portfolio  highlighting a range of my skills in; print design, logo design, web design  &amp; more…</p>
      <p class="style4"><br />
        I  started out creating fliers at Harbour Youth Service Coffs Harbour in 2003. I  have found many opportunities there for design. I was employed by Harbour Youth  Service in early 2008, after many years as a volunteer.  I continue to find  numerous occasions to contribute my design experience to my job as an administrative  assistant. I also work for Jetty Bunker Youth Service a few nights a week as a  support worker, teaching cooking to residents, assisting with menu plans and  shopping and whole range of other tasks.   </p>
      <p class="style4"> <br />
        <strong>I am currently available for  hire as a graphic designer, specialising in the fields of web design, print and logo design. </strong>With  the majority of my spare time spent researching various elements of graphic  design, as well as designing and implementing promotions for small businesses  such as logos, websites, posters, brochures and more…</p>
      <p class="style4"><br />
        A large part of my life is  dedicated to improving and expanding my techniques. I love design, I am  passionate about it, at times I even think about it in my sleep. It has become  apart of me and what I do and  continues to evolve within me.</p>
