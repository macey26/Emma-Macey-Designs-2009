Portfolio site from 2009, created with Dreamweaver, Flash and Illustrator. information and dates could be outdated
This Page was created as a mock portfolio page for a class assignment when i was studing new Media in 2009. It was created using 
a mixture of Dreamweaver, Flash and illustrator. I no longer subscribe to the adobe suite, so i have found it difficult to fix 
any bugs in the flash embedded navigation. It was a really fun page to make.
